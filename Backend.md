# Backend Developer

is a software developer who is responsible for building and managing the server-side logic of an application or website. They focus on the “behind the scenes” part of an application, which includes managing databases, servers, APIs, application architecture, security and updates. Backend developers ensure that data is processed correctly on the server and sent to the frontend (the part that is visible to the user) efficiently.

### **What does a Backend Engineer do?**

* API Development: Design and develop RESTful or GraphQL APIs.
* Database Management: Create, optimize, and manage databases.
* Server Management: Handle server infrastructure, including security and scalability.
* Integrating External Services: Work with third-party APIs and services.
* Optimize Backend Performance: Ensure the system can handle high traffic efficiently.
* Security: Implement security measures like authentication and authorization.
* Collaborate: Work closely with frontend engineers to integrate APIs with the user interface.
